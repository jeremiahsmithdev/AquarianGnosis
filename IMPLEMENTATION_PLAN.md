# Aquarian Gnosis - Multi-Phase Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the development of the Aquarian Gnosis platform into 5 distinct phases, from an achievable MVP to a fully-featured community platform. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring continuous value delivery while maintaining the modular architecture required for long-term expansion.

**Development Philosophy:**
- Each phase delivers standalone value
- Modular architecture from day one
- User feedback integration between phases
- Incremental complexity addition
- Future-proof foundation

## Phase 1: MVP - Core Map & Basic Community (Weeks 1-8)

### Primary Objective
Create a functional gnostic community map that allows users to register, add their location, and discover other gnostics nearby. This proves the core value proposition and establishes the foundation for all future features.

### Core Features
1. **Landing Page with Gnostic Cross Navigation**
   - Banyan tree background image implementation
   - SVG gnostic cross with four interactive quadrants
   - Responsive design across all devices
   - Basic transparent navigation

2. **User Registration & Authentication**
   - Email-based registration and verification
   - Basic user profiles (username, location preferences)
   - Simple privacy controls (public/private location)
   - JWT-based authentication system

3. **Interactive Map (Core Feature)**
   - Leaflet.js integration with OpenStreetMap
   - User location markers with privacy controls
   - Basic user discovery (find other users nearby)
   - Geolocation API integration
   - Distance-based filtering

4. **Basic Messaging System**
   - Platform-only user-to-user messaging
   - No external contact sharing (privacy-first)
   - Basic inbox/outbox functionality
