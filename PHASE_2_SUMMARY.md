## Remaining Tasks for Phase 2 Completion

### Backend
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite for new features
- [ ] Enable FastAPI automatic documentation
- [ ] Add structured logging system
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints

### Frontend
- [ ] Add proper error handling and loading states
- [ ] Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Add performance optimizations (code splitting, lazy loading)
- [ ] Create detailed resource view page
- [ ] Implement thread and reply viewing functionality
- [ ] Add search and filtering for community content

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Run database migrations to create new tables
- [ ] Update deployment scripts to handle new migrations
- [ ] Add monitoring and error tracking

## Next Steps
1. Test all new API endpoints with sample data
2. Implement frontend components for viewing threads and replies
3. Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application
4. Create detailed documentation for the new community features
5. Implement automated testing for backend and frontend components

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the community features outlined in Phase 2 of the project plan.
