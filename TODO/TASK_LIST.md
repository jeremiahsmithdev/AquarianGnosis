## Agent Instructions

Agents: Process tasks from the 'Task List' below that are not marked as complete. For each incomplete task, create a new task file in this directory using `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` as the template. Name the new file appropriately (e.g., `task_feature_x.md`, `task_fix_y.md`). Once a task has been fully transferred to its own independent task file, remove it from the 'Task List' below.
