# Task Prompt Form

This document serves as a task prompt form for AI agents and human engineers. It outlines the structure for defining, implementing, and tracking software development tasks. Agents should update each section as appropriate during task implementation.

## Task Description
**Instruction: This section contains the unique task prompt provided by the user. Read it carefully to understand the task requirements.**


## Testing
**Instruction: Test methodically after each implementation step. Any additional, user-specified testing instructions will be provided below.**


## Task Steps
**Instruction: This section is for the agent to record the active to-do list for task implementation. Keep it updated after each step to maintain a clear record of progress.**


## Task Clarifications
**Instruction: Use this section to clarify any uncertainties about the task description or implementation approach. Add clarification questions below and await user response before proceeding with implementation if critical. Example: "- [ ] Should I use library X or Y? --> <user response>"**


## Task Status
**Instruction: Update the task status below. Mark "Done" when implementation and agent testing are complete. Prompt the user to manually test and confirm before marking "User verified".**
Task status:
- [ ] Done
- [ ] User verified
