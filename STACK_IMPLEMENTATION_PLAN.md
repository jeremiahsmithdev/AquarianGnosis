## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing
- **Tailwind**: Visual regression testing for all components
- **Logging**: Verify structured logs and correlation IDs
- **Compression**: Browser dev tools network tab validation

### Phase 2 Testing
- **PWA**: Test install prompts, offline functionality, service worker updates
- **Mobile**: Cross-device testing, touch interactions, responsive breakpoints
- **Performance**: Lighthouse audits before/after

### Phase 3 Testing
- **Redis**: Cache performance, connection pooling, failover
- **Workers**: Task processing, error handling, queue monitoring
- **Load Testing**: Concurrent users with background tasks

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **CSS Migration**: Visual regressions during Tailwind conversion
2. **Service Workers**: Complex caching, browser compatibility
3. **Background Tasks**: Memory leaks, task failures

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Approach**: Convert CSS component by component
2. **Feature Flags**: Progressive PWA rollout
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated visual regression tests
4. **Monitoring**: Detailed logging and alerting
5. **Rollback Plan**: Keep current implementation until validation
